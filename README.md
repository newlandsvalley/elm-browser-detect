elm-browser-detect
==================

This is a simple Elm 0.18 program that illustrates how one might detect the browser.

I know you're not meant to do browser detection in favour of feature detection, but
I think I might need it because Firefox seems to implement sliders differently from
Chrome and Safari.

In any case, it illustrated a very simple use of programWithFlags.
